(Coles marketed the decrease as some “dropped and locked” thing as if they were doing the customer a favour lol truth is they just weren’t selling)

I imagine the same will happen here. I think this cheese has a relatively long shelf life tho so it may take some time. If it was a dairy item with a short shelf life/massive price hike, it’s likely a lot would start going to waste and they’d be forced to either bring the price back down or simply stop buying it from the supplier/no longer stock/significantly reduce limit to what they stock.","A year ago, this was $11 at the local Coles.

Colesworths prices on 1.25L Coke regularly double and then halve again (or halve, then double again, depending on your reference point).

They can effectively implement an overall inflation curve just through timing alone. Two points in time a year apart won't tell you enough to make a judgement on the overall shape of that curve.

2L Coke prices are much stabler.

I have this data for my own grocery shopping in Melbourne's east.

The bottom price point for 1.25L has increased 13% YoY.

The bottom price point for 2L has increased 27% YoY.

Data follows.

The reason your cheese slices are ridiculously priced (woolies are $14 for the same thing, btw) is too many snouts in the trough in between us as farmers and your fridge. Yes they are paying us more.. but that ‘more’ is 75c a litre. So someone is making some mega bucks off our hard work.. and it’s a bunch of shareholders for processors and supermarkets, not us as farmers.

We have an economic system and global supply chain that is built for maximum efficiency, meaning there was practically zero slack built into it for things like labour, emergency management, diversity of production etc. because this is what the economic gurus at consultancies like McKinsey, Boston etc. all recommended for 20-30 years.

This system didn't work out when some serious shocks started hitting the system and geopolitical realities exposed its flaws. As a result, governments and companies are having to patch up some serious holes in this supply chain.

This was exascerbated by the mass retirement of baby boomers over the past three years (turns out they were pretty productive after all), increasing strategic uncertainty in the Asia Pacific and Europe and with the low level civil war unfolding in the United States. This is all happening in the backdrop of China overtaking the United States in human capital, and in the size of its middle class - making it the consumer destination of the future (and all that entails).

There is an economic reckoning coming and even though our government just handed tens of billions of your dollars to companies for NOTHING, heaps of them are going to go to the wall. You can't stop the free market from punishing shit companies, you can only delay it and make it worse.  Well, we did that for 30 years - and REALLY took the piss the last 15 - and its time to pay the piper.","A year ago, this was $11 at the local Coles.

The Group has been impacted by significant inflationary cost pressure including elevated prices for 
farm gate milk reflecting strong global dairy commodity prices in calendar year 2022. In 1H FY2023 these cost pressures exceeded the level of price realisation that could be achieved in the 
Australian domestic market due to the lagged impact of price increase realisation. Prices in the 
Australian market now reflect the significant change in farm gate milk pricing that occurred on 1 
July 2022.

Despite a historically strong farm gate price, milk supply across Australia declined in the first half 
of FY2023 by 7%. The industry has been impacted by low labour availability, extensive flooding in
some regions, high land prices and the attraction of high prices in other agricultural commodities 
such as beef. Some of these milk production headwinds are expected to moderate in 2H FY2023

People in developing nations want to build as much wealth as possible to draw themselves and their families out of poverty and as they get more pieces of the pie, the developed world gets less. The reason our parents' generation had it easier is that it used to be the case that the developed countries were just competing amongst themselves. Now, when you compete you are competing with the entire globe. If you can't do a job well enough or cheap enough, someone else probably can elsewhere. Competition for labour drives down prices (this is why businesses love monopolies so much).

In essence, the issue is that most people in the developed world just want to do enough to coast by, while the culture in developing world is to be motivated to work hard and build wealth, and rich people don't give a crap who does the work, as long as the work gets done and they make as much money as possible.

There's no two ways about it. If you want to survive in the modern world, you need to be as good as or better than all the other 8 billion people, and having an attitude of - I just want to have enough to get by - just doesn't cut it anymore. If we try to isolate our economies in the developed world, we'll just end up being out-competed by developing countries and things would be even worse. Also, developing countries have the advantage of a big labour force and lower prices, but they are more susceptible to downturns like what's happening now. In Australia during a bad period we can't afford a house, in some developing countries thousands of people die.

There is a silver lining. With the internet it has never been easier to upskill. Stop trying to get by the way your parents did, and challenge yourself to be as multitalented as possible. That's the new bare minimum in 2023. But if it means people in other countries can pull themselves out of devastating poverty, isn't that a good thing?","I genuinely feel like our future was sold and I want to just give up","I’m a 31 year old sparky and I would consider myself a pretty simple man.

If assets like housing continue to increase exponentially and outpace wage growth, people will never be able to catch up to those who got on the ladder before them.

Because asset ownership is like owning a % of economic output, if your % of total asset ownership shrinks you get relatively poorer. Therefore the only way for any generation to get more of the economic output is to get more money via wages than assets produce, then use those wages to buy assets. If assets are vastly superior to wages, the system doesn’t work and progressive generations just get poorer. You can see this playing out today in how much “house” people can afford by generation.

The post-war boom and social democracy and social mobility we enjoyed between 1945 to 1985 was an aberration in historic terms. The ladder was being pulled up after the 2008 GFC austerity era.

Unions have largely been regulated out of business since the 90s and are fairly toothless in the private sector, they used to be very powerful and demand huge increases to incomes and working conditions. The lack of a large power alternative also means Western governments won’t change course without a shock - postwar the West used to compete with the Soviet Union and were petrified about revolutions and unrest in their own countries so as a compromise offered populations decent schools, hospitals and secure jobs and guaranteed housing.

I am a bit older than you so I am in the middle of this.  My generation was basically the last that could get in before the ladder was pulled up.  I looked into this by finding the current payrate for the jobs I've had over my career alongside the current cost of the homes I bought.  Turns out it's impossible to do what I did financially now as wages have gone nowhere and property prices have exploded.  

It works out if I had been born 15 years later but done everything else exactly the same in life the difference is about $700,000 of net worth for me.  So purely because I lived in a period where wages were higher and property was cheaper I got out of renting younger and onto the property ladder earlier and was able to get ahead.

Australia is a great country for wealthy older people they've effectively made slaves out the younger generation and immigrants.  They've captured the government which just protects their interests above anyone else.  

Honestly you probably need to look to leave the country.  It is not a country for a young person to work hard, get ahead have a family and build a good life anymore.","I genuinely feel like our future was sold and I want to just give up","I’m a 31 year old sparky and I would consider myself a pretty simple man.

Every night after work, dedicate an hour writing out the systems that would be needed to operate a sparky business.

-System for finding clients. How to get your business out there. Such as: Post in local communities once per week. Hire a freelancer to run google search ads for electrician solutions. 
- system for closing clients: How do you close deals at a high success rate etc. find out their objection: trust? Have a website with testimonials. Money? Assure them of your expertise or give a final discount which you don’t normally give.
- system for pricing…
- referrals/returns: how to make your customers really value the work they’ve done for you so that they hire you again.
- system for hiring: What are the characteristics and traits of the perfect person you would want in your team representing your company?
- Growth: this is a big one… you can’t be working in your business for too long. How can you expand your team and revenue without you putting in more hours… leveraging employees.

Start observing how the company you work for operates and take every process they use that’s effective and use it for your own business

I’ve got no experience in starting a trades business specifically, but systems are always necessary for any business to grow. and you need it if you want to earn a lot and get the home you want, rather than blaming outside circumstances. Look to yourself for the answer.

I’m on an above-average wicket, but with a family to support and a mortgage to pay, I don’t feel like I’ll ever get ahead. We’ve cut back so much that I just can’t imagine how families on lower incomes are coping. 

I look at my parents and the other boomers and feel so frustrated. They worked during a much easier time (financially) and are now sitting back on the other side of the interest rate rises enjoying every moment.

And our government keeps migration high, furthering the pain. We should all be way more rich thanks to our natural resources, but the government has decided that that wealth belongs to private enterprise.

At $200 p/w saving (which with no vices should be easy) is $10k a year so by 36 you could have atleast $50k as a deposit on a unit. I think you might be leaving out a flash car loan or expensive hobbies or wants. Or is it  just the fact you can't see yourself buying the mansion you want in the area you desire, I managed to buy a place  not quite what I dreamed of and definitely not in the area I most desired because it was what I could afford with 3 children and now have the equity to purchase another if wanted.
