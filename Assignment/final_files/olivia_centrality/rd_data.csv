Height Soo unfortunately I was NOT blessed with height and I stand at 5""2 or 157.48 cm which is really small for the average asian HAHHAH which usually stands at 5""3 or 5""5 at average. Do you recommend getting VIP standing tickets or are the lower box tickets, or any other equivalent better? Really need advice before I decide which tickets to get since I've been saving up!

Seeing you talk about camping out is like a dagger because I'm not doing that and you're probably not the only one who will.

Anyway, my only concern for you in regards to camping is that SF has a lot of people with drug addiction and mental health issues.  And that goes back years and years.  I can remember going to Union Square a few times a year for the past 10 years or so and always on the drive through the city there are people just yelling and shuffling around like crazy.  So just be safe.  I have a friend who works in the nightlife business and he said he saw more scary and freaky things working in SF than he ever did in Vegas, LA, or in Europe.  Have a buddy or two, maybe some pepper spray even.  And dress warm.  It gets cold at night.  Maybe you're from there and already know all this but incase you aren't.","'GUTS World Tour' Megathread - Part 3 ","Livies!

I'm wondering if there'll also be some of those special setups by AMEX or even if there is a possibility that she'll be partnering with other banks for the tour. Any thoughts?

Hey so recently bough VIP tickets for Olivia in Bangkok and the stage is set like this. ^(I) was able to get V1 and the red dot is supposedly where i am sitting. Now, when you look at this other picture on the right, it shows my seat, it says that I am right in front of the stage. But it does not add up because if u take a look at the right picture again looking at the red dot, there is no stage!!! I was honestly so so so excited I got ""front stage"" but now I'm a bit disappointed. Someone please explain!! PS: this event is all seating","'GUTS World Tour' Megathread - Part 3 ","Livies!

Took our almost 9 year old daughter who is on the spectrum.  Got merch (the San Francisco t-shirt and poster for her) and did the Guts Bus and had a blast.

We had the loop ear buds for her at the start (which we've used at the movie theatre and at an outdoor concert before) but switched to foam earplugs halfway through the show.  But it's so dang loud (crowds made up of young girls are louder than any other) that I wish we had brought full on ear muffs.  Lesson learned.  I'm sure people around us thought we were crap parents the way she was covering her ears 75% of the show.  Still, literally after every song we would ask her if she was having fun or if it was too loud she would answer ""fun"" and when we would ask her if she wanted to leave she would say ""no I want to stay to the end"".

I guess I'm mostly just writing this for any other parents who might be in a similar situation.  There was another girl sitting in section in front of us who also was clearly on the spectrum as well but she seemed to do fine with foam earplugs (she was a few years older than our daughter though).","'GUTS World Tour' Megathread - Part 3 ","Livies!

Although Taylor might surpass the two Dua Lipa albums, she will likely not surpass Olivia.

IF these rates stay constant, it would take 230 days for Lover to surpass Sour. However, we have to consider that Lover's daily streams were/are critically boosted by Cruel Summer, which has only been decreasing in popularity over the past few months, especially with TTPD taking attention away from it. Unless Cruel Summer can stay incredibly consistent for that long AND Sour doesn't get any boosts, Liv will stay on top. queen <3

So drivers license could be streamed 1 billion times, and brutal streamed 500 million and that would count as 1.5 billion streams for the album. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to listen to the album in its entirety to count as a stream. If you listened to sour once, it‚Äôd be 11 streams. If you listened to TTPD once, it would be 31 streams. The size isn‚Äôt an advantage, it‚Äôs that she had SO many bops on sour that there are multiple songs that were streamed over a billion times for a sum total of streams higher than any other album in Spotify history. There may be other albums with a single as successful as drivers license, but she also had Deja vu and good 4 u on the same album following right behind, making the total streams for the album record breaking.","sour is the most streamed female album in spotify history!","thought i should share, livies! congrats liv! heres to all the more success üíú

Sour is not the most streamed female album on Spotify of all time. If this is an official Spotify image, they are ABSOLUTE CLOWNS. Dua Lipa Complete Edition has over 10,000,000 more streams than it. Yes, Sour is getting more streams per day, so will probably surpass Dua Lipa, but it will still take several days (3+, so you can't say ""Spotify is just releasing numbers early"". If we are to watch numbers closely, it will take over 3 days, as much as 14 days to overtake Dua Lipa). Always fact check before believing a random post, whether or not it's from Spotify themselves. Not everyone uses data.","sour is the most streamed female album in spotify history!","thought i should share, livies! congrats liv! heres to all the more success üíú

Making the bed (lyrics absolutely wrecked me..relate to this song so hard. this song is truly for the self sabotage girlies)

Get him back! (unique flow and the chorus is addicting)

Ballad of a homeschooled girl (loved the pop punk sound and the vocals)

Pretty isn't pretty (love the message and the guitar)

Lacy (love how it sounds like nursery rhyme at times..its beautiful)","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

On a whole I prefer the album to Sour, it's more consistent throughout. I feel with Sour, it was fairly front loaded in that most of the songs I enjoyed were in the first half and the second half teetered off a bit; or at least the second half felt less polished. Guts starts and finishes much stronger, I thought All American Bitch was a great introduction and the transition into Bad Idea Right? made me appreciate that song far more than I had done listening to it in isolation.

Highlights for me were probably Love is Embarrassing going into The Grudge, both these songs are amazing and really show off some of the range that this album spans. Teenage Dream felt really honest and was a great example of Olivia's lyricism. 

I felt there were a couple of tracks in the middle of the album which were a bit weaker, Get Him Back was one track that stuck out to me that I didn't really enjoy. I can see what Liv was trying to do with the track, but the verses didn't work for me. The bridge goes a lot way to pulling the track up, but not really my jam as a whole.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

In her defense, the original eligibility was supposed to end August 31 but they moved it to September 15. So in the old period, this would‚Äôve been released fresh of the period. She could‚Äôve moved it though when Grammy extended the eligibility period but maybe it was too late to change their plans for the release. Though I don‚Äôt think they will give AOTY to TS since she‚Äôll be getting 4 and the Grammy won‚Äôt probably give it that way easily and imo, midnights is just not on par with her other aotys.

Background info - I just listened to Sour for the first time just like 3 weeks ago. üòÇ I had heard Driver‚Äôs License, Good 4 U, and Vampire a few times but nothing else. Then Bad Idea Right? came out and I really enjoyed it, so I gave her first album a shot and loved it! And I was really excited to learn her new album was gonna be out soon, so I‚Äôve been pretty excited to listen to Guts. Also, for myself as a songwriter, I‚Äôm very musically oriented, and I know Olivia is very lyrically oriented. I always listen for music first, lyrics second. I‚Äôm a 26 year old straight male, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the target demographic for her lyrics, but I respect her lyrics a ton and think she‚Äôs such a well-rounded songwriter, both lyrically and musically. 

My first impression is that it definitely has more rock and punk undertones than Sour, and that‚Äôs awesome. My favorite band is Green Day, so that kind of music has always drawn my attention. I think Olivia mentioned somewhere that some of these songs were recorded live with a band (as opposed to all of the instruments being recorded separately). I think that‚Äôs really cool too. It makes her seem so real in a world where computer-generated beats have been driving some of the most popular songs. I respect the hell out of her for that.

As for the production, it may have been the files I was listening to, but I wasn‚Äôt as big a fan of the production on a few of the songs. Making the Bed in particular was one I wasn‚Äôt super fond of the production on. The songwriting on it is fine, just how it sounds came off a little different to me. But I‚Äôm excited to hear it on Apple Music to hear it hopefully with a better quality and how it was intended. But first impression is that Sour had a bit tighter production.

What impressed me with this album was that she seemed to grow as a songwriter. A few more very different, unique songs on here that stood out. I think that‚Äôs cool, she‚Äôs showing off some of those chops and I hope that she continues to write music the same way throughout her whole career. Too many artists and bands stop writing their own music, and I think Olivia is talented enough to never make music that feels stale.

Overall, not as many songs were *instantly* memorable to me, but so many of them feel like they‚Äôre gonna grow on me to the point where I‚Äôll probably find a lot of them to be some of my favorite songs of hers. 

Current standouts to me: both singles, All-American Bitch, Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl (big Nirvana vibes here), Get Him Back!, Teenage Dream (this one really surprised me - shows her growth big time)

Others are also really good, some growers for sure. Making the Bed is probably lowest on my list, but once it‚Äôs out on Apple Music I‚Äôll give it a few more listens and see if I feel better about it. 

She‚Äôs made a new fan in the past few weeks! Excited for her to have a very successful, rewarding career! :)","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

SOUR was such a big hit that I was afraid Olivia would feel too pressured to make a good album, and it would show in the lyrics. Maybe feel too try-hard I guess.

That's not the vibes at all though! This is genuinely a no skip album. It's fresh and nostalgic at the same time, which is extremely hard for people to do even though we're in the age of everybody trying to do it.

Some people are saying certain tracks sound like early 2000's songs, specifically Miley Cyrus songs. I don't hear it as much as everybody else apparently does. I can sense a similar vibe though which is absolutely NOT copying. I've seen a lot of that accusations already but I disagree 10000%. Something will always sound like something else to a degree.

Anyways, my favorites on the album are The Grudge, Making the Bed, and All American Bitch. Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl is tied for third.

It's a pretty sad and angry album, but the fun of it is that it doesn't sound depressing and dreary. Don't get me wrong, I love depressing and dreary, but there's only so much of that even I can handle. I'm just happy with this album I don't really know how the majority are feeling about it yet cuz I'm just simply vibing to it for the most part.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

I feel like her songwriting is so much stronger and it‚Äôs FUNNY too, which is something which I don‚Äôt think we saw with her debut. I do think that the second half of the album is where she really hits her stride (ballad onwards), Lacey, All American Bitch and Teenage Dream just don‚Äôt really land for me and feel a bit overreaching, but the standouts are STANDOUTS. So many phenomenal songs. Making the Bed and Logical almost had me in tears, and I‚Äôm not really a ballad person so that shocked me.

Only one I don't enjoy as much is Lacy - it feels out of place from the rest of the songs?

Overall an awesome follow up, her vocals are insane and her lyricism has gotten so much stronger. I'm glad she leaned into this sound, it sounds like a natural progression from her debut and it aounds like she had so much fun making it.

As an artist her whole style, lyricism, pacing, control, and /controlled chaos/ of her power as a performer have matured so well, not changed, but /grown/. It feels like almost life-timing appropriate. It‚Äôs nostalgic for older people, and incredibly relatable for people the same age, as well as I feel exciting for younger people to look forward to relating to it all. I feel like she couldn‚Äôt have done better on her sophomore album if she tried because it‚Äôs so SO up-to-date but not out-pacing the present, if that makes sense?? Like I feel like the pacing is still going towards her peak and the rise is in perfect tempo with her life experience and maturity level if that makes sense?? Its youthful, but also self aware, chaotic and confusing and light hearted but also really serious, /just like the transition into early adulthood/!!!! Idk how she cracked the code to make me feel like I‚Äôm definitely listening to NEW music and I‚Äôm able to feel every risky new movement, yet at the same time it‚Äôs so familiar and nostalgic and /safe/.

This album, for me, took what made SOUR great and expanded on it ten-fold. Her voice is more powerful, the lyrics more poignant, and it definitely is more mature.

However, I could definitely say that about this album, I LOVED the indie-rock vibes and my favorite song for now is probably ballad of a homeschooled girl. But pretty isn‚Äôt pretty and teenage dream were also so relatable to me, specially teenage dream cause I‚Äôm the same age as her and it almost feels like this song was written for me.

In general I think it's a good mix between these two categories but I've got to say I would love a whole album with nearly only high energy songs and maybe two or three songs on the calmer side.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

It‚Äôs just SOUR but rebranded. For sour I think having one album that encapsulated the feelings of a breakup worked, but GUTS just feels like a continuation of ‚Äúoh man you hurt me, society hurt me, I‚Äôm awkward‚Äù and just unfortunately made the album just not for me. I like Olivia‚Äôs song writing and would look forward to her singing about other topics, but I guess I just feel burnt out with her current discography topics.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

It is somewhat of a departure from Sour and at this stage I‚Äôm still liking Sour more. The biggest difference for me is this is way more rock-heavy and feels almost not as polished as Sour production-wise and lyrically. This feels like a concerted effort from Olivia to separate herself sonically from what is ‚Äòpopular‚Äô music today. 

She also said the album feels ‚Äúhappier‚Äù, but I certainly didn‚Äôt get that impression. While the tempo of some songs are more upbeat than Sour, the themes are still a little dark and heavy.

That said, maybe the energy of these songs will be different when experienced live. She did say she wrote the album with a tour in mind and I can totally see some of these songs going off in concert.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

My expectations were high because of Vampire. It‚Äôs easily the best song on the album, maybe out of both albums. 

I think she took the Taylor Swift comparisons too seriously and tried a little too hard to differentiate herself by going a completely different route with a more pop-rock-ish sound but it just seemed messy and lacking cohesion in most songs. Like the first two minutes of AAB were REALLY good, but the ending was awful and kinda ruined it for me. 

My favorites, after vampire, are the grudge, logical, the first part of AAB, and get him back. 

Olivia is hilariously relatable though, I will give her that. I like how she effortlessly ties in her humor into her music. Sour was more deeply emotional with pure pain you could feel in her vocals, and also less drowned out by production than Guts, which is why it‚Äôs still better to me. But overall both are great albums and I can‚Äôt wait for the deluxe tracks.","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

Like all-american bitch reminds me a lot of The Beths, musically speaking. Check out their song Don't Go Away, or Great No One

Maybe 3AM by Kate Nash too? *Maaaaybe* Scratchcard Lanyard by Dry Cleaning but that one's a bit weirder. Ymmv with these.

I absolutely loved Sour when it came out in 2021. I had that album on repeat for several weeks straight, however, this album is just.. ok. The only songs I really like are ""all american bitch"", ""pretty isn‚Äôt pretty,"" ,  ""ballad of a homeschooled Girl"", and ‚Äúlove is embarrassing‚Äù. The rest of the songs are pretty skippable. I don‚Äôt know, I guess I expected something else; many of the songs sound like they were rejects from Sour.  Also, from the GUTS album cover to the songs... It just doesn‚Äôt feel like a different era in terms of her music or vibes. I kind of expected something like when Billie Eilish released her second album, where Billie‚Äôs sound and looks were noticeably different from her first album‚Äîit actually felt like a different and fresh era. I wish Olivia all the best, though. I really hope this album does well. :)","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

*emphasis on ‚Äúfirst listen‚Äù

Predictions:

- I feel like I‚Äôll fall so in love with making the bed and pretty isn‚Äôt pretty after a few listens. 
- I‚Äôd probably receive a lot of hate for my rating on Lacy/Ballad of a homeschooled girl.


The album was everything but (here it is, I‚Äôm going to say it) I felt a stronger connection with SOUR. I know some of you will say that it‚Äôs too early to conclude anything, which is why I‚Äôm adding emphasis again on the first two words in this post (in case some of you don‚Äôt know how to read). I loveeeddd the intros of the songs, but when it came to the last part of some songs, specifically the bridge, it got noisy or became less likable. I felt the same way with my first listen to ‚Äòbad idea right?‚Äô but ended up loving it after a few listen, sometimes. I love that there are some hints of SOUR in the style of production and genre, but what I particularly loved was that it doesn‚Äôt sound like any of Olivia‚Äôs other songs (unlike ‚Äòvampire‚Äô), which is a good thing because, in my case, I didn‚Äôt sense any repetition. Overall, the album is great, but I expected a lot more, even though at the same time, I didn‚Äôt. In my opinion, it would‚Äôve been better if she strayed closer to rock rather than what I would call ‚Äòmessy‚Äô pop punk. I have a hate and love relationship with her style with pop punk, so hopefully I can learn how to love it. 


I would give this album a 3.9 ‚≠êÔ∏è (didn‚Äôt calculate the average of my ratings, solely based on my personal opinion).","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

i 100% get what she means when she said she was thinking about live performances when she was writing this. i think it will be a really fun tour. i still stand by the fact it shouldve been a red outfit and im guessing a lot of red outfits will be on tour. 

personally, i went through a breakup right when SOUR came out and it was perfect and right now the vibe of GUTS fits a lot of aspects of my life right now so i really lucked out. i can see people who were huge SOUR fans be disappointed if they are expecting the same thing. personally,i like that she is taking a different turn. it doesnt mean she wont ever go back to SOUR vibes, but if it was too similar to SOUR people would critic her for not being able to make anything different (and now im sure people will critic it for being different, young female artists cant win). 

as someone who likes imagery, i really think that the album cover should have had a lot more energy/be more exciting, but that is a personal critic. its not a bad image, its just my biggest disappointment. 

i think this is like ""rock"" for girls about things mostly girls would relate to which i think is a fairly niche genre but nice to see. its something she does really good is write about really relatable things in a interesting way. i could be wrong, but i dont think this will be as big as SOUR, but that is primarily because SOUR was SO big it would be shocking if she met or surpassed that success. i also think that with SOUR the main theme of heartbreak is such a universal experience and she wrote songs in a unique perspective that a lot of people connected to which contributed to the popularity, i think some of the songs on GUTS are a little more niche and not everyone will be able to connect with everyone AND like the sound of the song. its by no means this alternative, indie, never heard before sound, but i think overall the sound is more catering to a specific taste than SOUR. 

i will admit i was a little skeptical the last few months because i didnt see the connections between vampire, bad idea, right, the album image, the rest of the song titles, plus what she said about it being rock/angst, but it did all connect (minus the album cover for me i just think it could be better) 

lastly, get this girl a good boyfriend!!! if she cant find a nice guy how the hell are the rest of us supposed to find one???","'GUTS' Album Discussion Megathread","ü¶ã Livies! **Please use this megathread** to discuss your thoughts on Olivia's album, [GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)!

I really liked Drivers License but never listened to the rest of SOUR. Sometime after GUTS came out I listened to both albums back to back and I was blown away. I was not expecting to enjoy her music this much. 

The music she makes sounds so sincere, there's a vulnerability that you can hear in her voice. She just sounds like a real person talking about real shit. She's not forcing a persona or anything like that. That's what I find most endearing about her. SOUR just had this feeling like you were listening to someone read their diary to you. 

Also she's just so fucking talented. Even if the lyrics don't do anything for you just close your eyes and listen to one of her live performances. I've been telling anyone that will listen to check out her performance of Vampire on Stephen Colbert. That was the video that got me frantically scrolling through Seat Geek for tickets.","Why do you think SOUR did so well?","I completely fell in love with Olivia after drivers license and was so excited to hear her new stuff (and loved everything she‚Äôs released since).

I‚Äôm an older fan (early 30s), so I was not a HSMTMTS fan/didn‚Äôt have any context for her. My ex and I are big music fans in general and I remember him asking if I‚Äôd heard drivers license yet because he‚Äôd heard it and was blown away and thought I would. And well, he was right.

But I didn‚Äôt listen to Sour fully until after Guts came out. Guts floored me (in a good way) and I revisited Sour). You summarized it well - here‚Äôs an artist who is writing and singing about what is real and personal to her. It doesn‚Äôt feel fully contrived. And she can ACTUALLY sing. 

There‚Äôs something refreshing about a musician and performer who can craft songs capturing emotions in a skilled way that can do both ballads (drivers license, de ja vue) and the energy pumping, but still smart fun pop songs (bad idea, get him back).

It‚Äôs also just an amazing album where imo there are 2 skips for me but I know many people who adore those songs and one of them is literally 1b views now lol so I may be an anomaly (sorry it‚Äôs favourite crime)","Why do you think SOUR did so well?","I completely fell in love with Olivia after drivers license and was so excited to hear her new stuff (and loved everything she‚Äôs released since).

Olivia was a Disney girl who had been on television for 6 or 7 years before Sour.  I'm old enough that Britney/Justin/Christina were big names.  But I was already too old when Miley and Selena first came out to know much about them. I guess I did sort of know Miley because it seemed like Hannah Montana was everywhere and people would say ""That's Billy Ray Cyrus daughter"".  But I didn't know about Selena or Wizards of Waverley Place.  I was just too old.  I suspect it's a little that way with Olivia.  Like if right now you're between 16-22 you probably knew all about Olivia and watched Bizaardvark and followed her on socials.  But if right now you're like mid 20's or up, maybe you were already too old to be aware of her from that?

That being said, I think you are so correct about the ""real and honest"" aspect.  I was so beyond sick of all the rap/hip-hop and bling-bling type of music that had been popular for the past 20 years.  I had stopped listening to most of the top 40 type of stations because of that.  This was a refreshing change.

And also, her music is just good.  Lyrics are top tier, beats are good, she can play multiple live instruments, and she has an amazing voice.  I think vocally she's a lot more talented than most other singers in her genre.","Why do you think SOUR did so well?","I completely fell in love with Olivia after drivers license and was so excited to hear her new stuff (and loved everything she‚Äôs released since).

The ache of ""Pretty isn't Pretty"" is just an excellent take on life from a young woman's perspective trying to fit into the 'norm'. Just love that song. 

'The Grudge' and 'Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl"" could not be more different from a vibe perspective but are strong songs and performances. ""Making the Bed"" is a soulful approach on how life was treating the subject, just really articulated well. 

To sum up a bit, the range and lyrics on the album stand out for me as very strong and I'm very glad to have listened to the album and have it as my favorite this year, I got the CD to play in the car and it is no skips.....ever.","Why do you think SOUR did so well?","I completely fell in love with Olivia after drivers license and was so excited to hear her new stuff (and loved everything she‚Äôs released since).
