Ari’s media machine has totally glossed over her heinous actions. She’s issued no apology to fans, to the man’s wife and baby, to her costars for tainting the movie Wicked with Ari’s shenanigans. 

Also you can tell she’s not doing well health wise, probably because she’s isolating herself. The woman needs more support from other people, not less. People with EDs are notorious for icing everyone out and thinking everyone is out to get them.

IMO, Positions feels basic and honestly just not good. A lot of the lyrics range from okay to horrible, and while I loooove the strings, it doesn’t fit some of the songs they’re put in. All the songs also sound the same to me and there was only a couple I actually liked. My boyfriend who studies music and actually knows his stuff heavily disliked it as well. Even aesthetic wise it’s one of my least favorites. The green is kind of ugly imo and I’m just not a fan of her hairstyle for this album, but I do commend her for trying a different look and the outfit is pretty imo. 

Yeah TUN was rushed and Sweetener while having a ton of good songs, is very experimental and at times can feel heavily disjointed, (This is coming from someone who has TUN as their favorite album and Sweetener as their second favorite album lol) but I do think they are leagues better than Positions. Positions was just kind of disappointing for me which saddens me to say since I had high hopes! I love Ariana but this album just wasn’t it for me. 

But that’s my opinion and of course you’re allowed to have your own. I’m not attacking you or saying you’re wrong or anything, just explaining why I personally don’t like Positions. :)

Edit: to clarify because people are misconstruing what I said, NO Because my BF studies music doesn’t mean his opinion is better than anyone else’s. I meant to imply it was more informed than my opinion because he actually knows why it sounds bad on a technical level. I try to have a fun discussion with everyone and everyone else was discussing their opinion freely so idk why I get attacked but oh well lol. Please be respectful in the replies. I said people can disagree with me and I said no one is wrong for liking the album. I just want everyone to be respectful to me like I try to be to them. I’m only human and words hurt :) So lets all just have a fun time and be respectful and use kind words. After all we all love Ari so we should be like a big happy family.","Unpopular opinion (I think): positions is her best album since dangerous woman","","https://i.redd.it/9rfyc3q8kko61.jpg","i.redd.it","https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianaGrande/comments/malt9p/unpopular_opinion_i_think_positions_is_her_best/","malt9p"

Dangerous woman is her less successful area (except Your truly). Focus was clearly supposed to be the lead, but as it flopped, they dissociated the song from the rest of the area and annunced Dangerous woman would be the first official single. Dangerous woman didn't do well, it peaked at number 10 and didn't spend any others weeks in the top 10, mediatraffic's score >  2,053,000 points, this is a commercial failure considering she had literally exploded internationally with My everything and had big world wide hits: Problem, Break Free, Bang Bang, all top 5 hits with good longevity.

Into You didn't make it to the top 10 and peaked at 13 with a REMIX, it's a failure. Mediatraffic score> 1,780,000 points , this is one of Ariana Grande less successful single since she blew up.

Side to side is the only hit of the area and it peaked at number 4. Mediatraffic score> 3,200,000 points.

Everyday isn't worth discussing, it flopped hard.

Let me remind you that the single Positions peaked at number 1, stayed 17 weeks in the top 10, has  3,557,000 points  and has a better mediatraffic score than the biggest single of DW's area aka Side to side, after only 4.5 months of exploitation, which means the single will probably finish with a similar score to Problem.

34+35 already outsell Into You, Dangerous woman and Everyday with 2.600.000 points and will surpass Side to side at the end of the year for sure. It peaked at number 2 and stayed 10 weeks in the top 10, it still is in the top 10 right now.

IMO, Positions feels basic and honestly just not good. A lot of the lyrics range from okay to horrible, and while I loooove the strings, it doesn’t fit some of the songs they’re put in. All the songs also sound the same to me and there was only a couple I actually liked. My boyfriend who studies music and actually knows his stuff heavily disliked it as well. Even aesthetic wise it’s one of my least favorites. The green is kind of ugly imo and I’m just not a fan of her hairstyle for this album, but I do commend her for trying a different look and the outfit is pretty imo. 

Yeah TUN was rushed and Sweetener while having a ton of good songs, is very experimental and at times can feel heavily disjointed, (This is coming from someone who has TUN as their favorite album and Sweetener as their second favorite album lol) but I do think they are leagues better than Positions. Positions was just kind of disappointing for me which saddens me to say since I had high hopes! I love Ariana but this album just wasn’t it for me. 

But that’s my opinion and of course you’re allowed to have your own. I’m not attacking you or saying you’re wrong or anything, just explaining why I personally don’t like Positions. :)

Edit: to clarify because people are misconstruing what I said, NO Because my BF studies music doesn’t mean his opinion is better than anyone else’s. I meant to imply it was more informed than my opinion because he actually knows why it sounds bad on a technical level. I try to have a fun discussion with everyone and everyone else was discussing their opinion freely so idk why I get attacked but oh well lol. Please be respectful in the replies. I said people can disagree with me and I said no one is wrong for liking the album. I just want everyone to be respectful to me like I try to be to them. I’m only human and words hurt :) So lets all just have a fun time and be respectful and use kind words. After all we all love Ari so we should be like a big happy family.","Unpopular opinion (I think): positions is her best album since dangerous woman","","https://i.redd.it/9rfyc3q8kko61.jpg","i.redd.it","https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianaGrande/comments/malt9p/unpopular_opinion_i_think_positions_is_her_best/","malt9p"

Dangerous woman is her less successful area (except Your truly). Focus was clearly supposed to be the lead, but as it flopped, they dissociated the song from the rest of the area and annunced Dangerous woman would be the first official single. Dangerous woman didn't do well, it peaked at number 10 and didn't spend any others weeks in the top 10, mediatraffic's score >  2,053,000 points, this is a commercial failure considering she had literally exploded internationally with My everything and had big world wide hits: Problem, Break Free, Bang Bang, all top 5 hits with good longevity.

Into You didn't make it to the top 10 and peaked at 13 with a REMIX, it's a failure. Mediatraffic score> 1,780,000 points , this is one of Ariana Grande less successful single since she blew up.

Side to side is the only hit of the area and it peaked at number 4. Mediatraffic score> 3,200,000 points.

Everyday isn't worth discussing, it flopped hard.

Let me remind you that the single Positions peaked at number 1, stayed 17 weeks in the top 10, has  3,557,000 points  and has a better mediatraffic score than the biggest single of DW's area aka Side to side, after only 4.5 months of exploitation, which means the single will probably finish with a similar score to Problem.

34+35 already outsell Into You, Dangerous woman and Everyday with 2.600.000 points and will surpass Side to side at the end of the year for sure. It peaked at number 2 and stayed 10 weeks in the top 10, it still is in the top 10 right now.

Mediatraffic takes Digital/Physical sales, stream, radio diffusion, ect.
